## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **17-year-old backend developer** with a passion for creating robust, scalable web applications. Started my coding journey at **12** and have been building with Python and Flask ever since. I love solving complex problems and turning ideas into reality through clean, efficient code.

```python
class Developer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "George Lorentzos"
        self.age = 17
        self.role = "Backend Developer"
        self.languages = ["Python", "JavaScript", "SQL"]
        self.passion = "Building scalable web applications"
        self.currently_learning = ["Advanced Flask patterns", "System design"]
    
    def say_hi(self):
        return "Thanks for dropping by! Let's build something amazing together! 🚀"
```
